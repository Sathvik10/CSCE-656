My primary focus was on Post-Fulfilment (Financials), and I played a key role in a modernization initiative that involved building a new Order Management System based on microservices architecture.\n - In this initiative, I led the modernization efforts for the invoicing service, catering to 69 million Sam's Club customers across the United States. The new system achieved a processing speed of 10,000 records per minute, significantly reducing accounting discrepancies from $44 million to $8 million. \n - Over the span of two years, I contributed to various projects, including Healer Service, Distributed ID Generator, and State Machine for Order Orchestration. In addition to my technical involvement in multiple projects, I mentored four colleagues and received a Bravo Award for exceptional time management and collaboration skills in a fast-paced environment.",

Although most of the movies are dubbed in other languages, they lose their visual authenticity.</li><li><b>Deepfake Technology</b>: It has a lot of potential in movie creation and visual effects, but it also poses significant ethical concerns. It can be a potential threat to an actor's career.</li><li><b>Oversaturation</b>: Due to the abundance of content online, the material gets saturated.
